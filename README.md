A quality management system consists of the organizational structure, responsibilities, procedures, and resources to ensure products, processes or services satisfy stated or implicit needs (ISO 8402). In conclusion, PERTEKMA Activity Monitoring beneficial in improving the current traditional way of monitoring student’s activity. This system provides efficiency in managing their activity record.

i) To propose a workflow of the activity execution of PERTEKMA's exco in managing their activities
